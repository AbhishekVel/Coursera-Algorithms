# CourseraAlgorithms

This is a documentation of all the algorithms I coded as a part of taking the Coursera Specizilation on Algorithms.

Note: Not all of the code in this project is a part of the graded programming assignments on Coursera. Some of the algorithms were coded just for #better understanding.

I strongly disaprove of the copying of the coded algorithms to cheat to on the programming assignments on Coursera, so I kindly ask you not to cheat yourself by using this for your programming assignments on Coursera. Instead, if you are absolutely stuck on an assignemnt, feel free to view my code to help give you a better understanding and use it as a guide instead of simply copying.
