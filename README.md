# CourseraAlgorithms

This is a documentation of all the algorithms I coded as a part of taking the Coursera Specizilation on Algorithms.

Note: Not all of the code in this project is a part of the graded programming assignments on Coursera. Some of the algorithms were coded just for better understanding.
